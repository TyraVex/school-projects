# The "moto-ventilateur" project

The "moto-ventilateur" is the name given to our first project of the "Présentation Systèmes" subject.
It consists in connecting an Arduino Orion board, a 7-segment display, an ultrasonic sensor, and a motor-fan, in order to build an intelligent fan.
Indeed, thanks to its sensor and its micro-controller, it is able to detect and treat the obstacles placed in front of the propeller, and act consequently: if an object such as a hand is placed at less than 10 cm of the propeller, it will stop itself.
